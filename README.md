**Acknowledgement**: This Summer school is partially funded by ***Science and research Fund at Sofia University (contract 80-10-126-16.05.2022)***. 

**Location**: [Bachkovo Monastery](http://www.bachkovskimanastir.com/bg/), Plovdiv Region, Bulgaria

**Time**: August 26 - September 04, 2022 

**Target audience**: PhD students in their first 18 months and advanced graduates (master students).  

**Official language**: For written materials - Bulgarian or English, for lectures - Bulgarian.

**Application**: **<span style="color: red;">EXTENDED</span>** Deadline for student application is July 20, 2022 by filling-in this application form: [https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9](https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9).    
Only some applications would be approved, who will be notified by e-mail on July 25 and will recieve further instructions.    
Participation in the Summer school is free of charge.

## Main objectives
* Creating an attitude for studying and applying scientific methods in research.
* Winning the hearts and minds of learners to apply the scientific method.
* Permanent change of students' attitudes.
* Upgrading the knowledge and skills for scientific work

**Concept**: Intensive training in methods (not so much applications) through lectures, workshops and team work on projects. 

## Accomodation
**Travel**: The trip is up to the participants to organize on their own (while some coordination effort will be done for optimizing the travel organization. Everyone should arrive by **18:30, on 26 August, Friday**, at the main entrance of the Monastery.
